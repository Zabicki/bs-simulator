# Billing system simulator
<p>The goal of this project is to simulate some mass processes that are handled by a billing system and measure how
different database solutions and models handle the load and meet other requirements set by a billing system.</p>
There are 2 simulated processes:
<ol>
    <li>invoicing</li>
    <li>data synchronization to the billing system</li>
</ol>
